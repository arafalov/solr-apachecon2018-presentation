# Summary

Research, configurations, and backing content for the ApacheCon 2018 presentation 
[From content to search: speed-dating Apache Solr](https://apachecon.dukecon.org/acna/2018/#/scheduledEvent/7235c1f684eaa9567) (50 minutes).

# Description:
While fully nuanced search implementation takes time, getting basic data ingestion, schema design and critical-path insights does not have to be a painful experience.

In this talk, we will use several real-life datasets (from [Data is Plural](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural) mailing list) and show "Rapid Application Development"-style workflow to get the data into Solr and shape it ready for initial searchability and relevancy analysis.

Different stages of content ingestion, pre-processing, analysis, and querying will be explained, together with trade-offs of different built-in approaches.

This talk is for everybody who wanted Search in their development stack but is not sure exactly where to start.
